* This is a new release.

Nov 16th, 2024. I have addressed Uwe Ligges comments on spell check in Rd and DESCRIPTION files.
Uwe also suggested me to include a reference on the method, if available. However, there is no article 
published yet on the method. The manuscript describing it was already submitted and is currently under 
consideration for a  journal in the area.
