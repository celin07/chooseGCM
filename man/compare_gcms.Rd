\title{Compare GCMS}
\usage{
compare_gcms(s, var_names = c("bio_1", "bio_12"), study_area = NULL, k = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{s}{A list of stacks of General Circulation Models.}

\item{var_names}{Character. A vector with names of the bioclimatic variables to compare OR 'all'.}

\item{study_area}{Extent object, or any object from which an Extent object can be extracted. A object that defines the study area for cropping and masking the rasters.}

\item{k}{Numeric. The number of clusters to use for k-means clustering.}
}
\value{
A list with two items: suggested_gcms (the names of the GCMs suggested for further analysis) and statistics_gcms (a grid of plots).
}
\description{
This function compares future climate projections from multiple Global Circulation Models (GCMs) based on their similarity in terms of bioclimatic variables. The function clusters the GCMs using k-means clustering and hierarchical clustering, calculates the Euclidean distance matrix, and generates plots for the clusters and the distance matrix.
