Title: chooseGCM: A package for selecting General Circulation
    Models for Species Distribution Modeling in R
Version: 1.0
Author: Luíz Fernando Esser, Dayani Bailly, Marcos Robalinho Lima and Reginaldo Ré

Description: This package is intended to help modelers to
    select General Circulation Models (GCMs) to project Species
    Distribution Models to future scenarios. The package uses
    clusterization to detect GCMs that are more different from one
    another, avoiding highly correlated GCMs.
